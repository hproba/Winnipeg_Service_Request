# Winnipeg_Service_Request

In this project I'm using a dataset from the Winnipeg Open Data Portal which displays the Population's service requests. My goal here is to analyze the data and display some interesting insights, plots, trends and at the end show a map (using geopandas) where I'll be abe to see the location of each service request on it.

ps: The Dataset can be found here: https://data.winnipeg.ca/Contact-Centre-311/311-Service-Request/4her-3th5
